Russian to English verb conjugation training script (Dmitry Petrov methodology)

This is actually my first Javascript project bigger than a couple of classes. Nevertheless, it's been made solely for home use and the code quality is pretty low. I just challenged myself whether I could make it, and here is the result.

## Usage
`npm build` creates two files:

* `index.html` - HTML page with a minimalistic UI
* `app.js` - the application logic compiled into a single Javascript file
